# OddJobs.ca

OddJobs.ca is the professional hub for all odd jobs in Canada.

OddJobs.ca aims to be a niche job site for all the unusual jobs out there, putting together a hub with jobs that are unusual or odd in different ways:

Freelance, seasonal, temporary, contracts, projects and part-time jobs are all part of the odd jobs.  

But more importantly, this is where recruiters will be able to post unusual and rare jobs and where job seekers are able to find the interesting and rare job opportunities that are hard to come by.  It becomes an interesting site to visit to find a gig for the weekend or an exciting project for the season.

Users will need to sign up for an account to post a job posting but any one browsing the job site and view the job listing.
